<h1> About Me</h1>

<p> I'm 18 years old, and currently a freshman at The University of Rhode Island. My major is computer science :). 
I was first introduced to coding my junior year of highschool. At first, I hated computer science, but then I started practicing more 
and realized that I could make a career out of it. <p>
