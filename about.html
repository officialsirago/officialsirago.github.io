    <h1>Welcome To Nyla's Programming Portfolio!</h1>

    <p>
      I'm 18 years old, and currently a freshman at The University of Rhode
      Island. My major is computer science :). I was first introduced to coding
      my junior year of highschool. At first, I hated computer science, but then
      I started practicing more and realized that I could make a career out of
      it.
