    <h1>Welcome To Nyla's Programming Portfolio! </h1>

    <p>
      This is my programming portfolio for CSC106 at the
      <a href="http://www.uri.edu">University of Rhode Island.</a> It's my first
      time taking this course, and it has been challenging but rewarding as
      well. 
      
      I took comp sci both my senior and junior year of highschool!
    </p>

      This website is for a project due in december, where me ad my classmates use html attributes to make a website. 
      I'm excited to share it all.
